    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement is to create the Railway Management System that develops a user-friendly software application that facilitates various functionalities related to railway ticketing and management. The system should allow users to book tickets, cancel booking, check fares, view their bookings, and display available trains.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Case Study:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where a railway company needs a modern and efficient system to handle their ticketing and management operations. The current manual process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks flexibility. They want to automate these processes and provide a convenient platform for their customers to book tickets, check fares, and manage their reservations easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis Part:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data analysis part of the Railway Management System involves analysing the data collected from various sources, such as customer bookings, train schedules, and fare information. This analysis helps in gaining insights into customer preferences, popular routes etc.• Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the Railway Management System is to streamline and automate the ticketing and management processes for both the railway company and its customers. The specific objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ticket Booking: Allow users to book tickets conveniently by selecting the desired train, class, and travel date. The system should validate the availability of seats and provide a confirmation for successful bookings.\n",

    "Reservation Cancellation: Provide users with the\n",
    "\n",
    "option to cancel their booked tickets if required. The\n",
    "\n",
    "system should handle cancellation requests, update\n",
    "\n",
    "seat availability, and process refunds if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Fare Checking: Enable users to check fares for different trains, classes, and routes before making a booking. The system should fetch the fare details from the database and display them accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Booking History: Allow users to view their booking history, including details such as train name, departure/arrival times, class, and booking status.This feature helps users keep track of their travel history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train Availability: Provide users with an up-to-date list of available trains based on the selected source and destination. The system should display relevant details like train name, departure/arrival times, and seat availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Menu: Display a menu to users, showcasing the available options and functionalities of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Exit: Allow users to exit the program gracefully when they have completed their tasks."
